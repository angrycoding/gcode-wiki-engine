Recreating Google Code Wiki
==================

Wikiwym is a JavaScript - based parser for the Google Code wiki syntax.
Using this parser you can easily transform Google Code wiki syntax into HTML.
It's simple, fast and reliable solution to generate HTML code out of Wiki syntax
source, and what is also very important this can be done in non - browser
environment (like Mozilla Rhino or Google V8), so you can even make some
automated tool which for example generates documentation out of wiki syntax
markdown on top of it.
